# UFOs

# Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Results
The search criteria now has five options to narrow down specific results. You can search based off of date, city, state, country, and shape. Let's say you decide to search based off state name. You will go to the search box  with the name "Enter State" in there you will type of the state abbreviation, like "CO" and press "enter" on your keyboard. The results will be filtered and you will have information on sigtings in four different cities in Colorado.

# Summary
- One drawback to the website would be that the filtered data only gives a quick comment on the sighting. There might be room add in an article or news clip if possible for more information on potential sightings.

- A recommendation is just adding more data. There's always more out there if there was a way to add more description or information to make this website more rounded that can increase the traffic the website has.
